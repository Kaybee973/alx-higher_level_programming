Python Tuples vs. Lists
Tuples and lists are both used to store collection of data
Tuples and lists are both heterogeneous data types means that you can store any kind of data type.
Tuples and lists are both ordered means the order in which you put the items are kept.
Tuples and lists are both sequential data types so you can iterate over the items contained.
Items of both tuples and lists can be accessed by an integer index operator, provided in square brackets, [index].
